# Internet_Firewall_Prediction_Deployment
Aim of the project:
- The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model for the classification of actions based on Internet firewall data. 
- The model will analyze firewall logs and accurately classify each action into predefined categories, enabling efficient monitoring and identification of potential security threats or anomalous behavior.
- By achieving this objective, the project aims to enhance network security and enable timely responses to reduce risks and protect sensitive data. 

Q. What is internet firewall ??
- A Firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization’s previously established security policies. At its most basic, a firewall is essentially the barrier that sits between a private internal network and the public Internet.
- Mainly allowing non-threatening traffic in and to keep dangerous traffic out.

Q. Why Internet Firewall ??
- As a Data Analyst we come across the data very often all our work is done on the data.
- Firewalls can prevent harmful malware from gaining access to a computer or network through the internet defending your computer or network from outside cyber attackers.
- Sometime the data we work on can be very sensitive and should be kept confidential as per the company guidelines as for to keep the relationships between company and clients on good terms without compromising the data.

Model used:

KNN
Decision Tree
Random Forest
SVM(Kernel used: 'linear', 'sigmoid','rbf’)
Naive Bayes



 
 
  
  Model Name                         Accuracy

  1. KNN                              99.34
  
  2. Decision Tree                    99.77

  3. Random Forest                    99.81

  4. SVM                              99.20
  5. Naïve Bayes                      51.10
  
  
  Conclusion:
 - As we can see after applying several model the best accuracy / model we can get is from Decision Tree.
- Though other models are also performing good except for Naive Bayes they are not doing good for class 4 in terms of predictions.
- So we can conclude that decision tree is giving the best accuracy and prediction of all the other model.
- That is accuracy of 99.77

Applications:
- Network Security: Firewall prediction can be used by network administrators to improve the effectiveness of their firewall configurations.
- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): Firewall prediction can be integrated into IDS systems to detect and prevent malicious activities. By analyzing network traffic in real-time
- Proactive Security Measures: The firewall prediction project can help organizations take proactive security measures by identifying emerging threats and vulnerabilities. By analyzing historical data and using machine learning techniques

My learning from the project:
- Decision making. 
- Time management.
- Critical Thinking.
- How is modeling important for business to reach a certain decision.

Business Insights:
- No proper security can lead to data loss.
- The customer privacy can be compromised.
- Losing data can compromise customer relationship with the company.
- Can lose the trusted customer.
